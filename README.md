# Film Developing Tank Automatic Agitator

A simple project which uses an ESP32 (in my case an ESP32-C3 Super Mini, but most any ESP32 board should work) to control a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor with ULN2003 driver which is attached to the center column of a film developing tank. I am using a 3D printed design found [here](https://www.printables.com/model/736613-paterson-film-developing-tank-motorization-setup), but any method of attaching the center column of the tank to the stepper motor should work. Other stepper motors/drivers should also work so long as you set them up correctly with the AccelStepper library. 

The interface is fairly simple and is hosted via ESPAsyncWebServer either on the local LAN (serial will show the IP address, so you may want to have it plugged in to your computer with a serial monitor the first run to get the IP address) or on its own access point if you remove the `USE_STA_MODE` define. To operate the agitator, you go to the IP address given and you will see the UI. There are two sliders - the top one controls the speed of the stepper motor and the bottom one controls how often it switches direction. The agitation will just oscillate back and forth at the set speed and interval. To start the agitation process, simply press the start button and to stop it press the stop button. To save the currently configured values for the speed and interval you can press the "Save Settings" button.
